During the last few years, the efficiency of solar cells could be raised significantly through research and development on different aspects of the solar cell. Besides reducing electrical losses and improving the materials used in solar cells (such as the material for the semi-conductor), we can also try to improve optical properties of the solar cell. On the one hand-side, it is important to reduce reflections and on the other hand-side, it is important to guide as much light as possible to the optical active areas. 
In this Bachelorthesis, we will concentrate on guiding as much light as possible to the optical active areas.
One issue concerning this is cloaking the contact fingers and bus-bars on solar cells to guide the light, which would have hit the contact grid on solar cells, to the optical active areas. This can be used to enhance the efficiency of solar cells.
