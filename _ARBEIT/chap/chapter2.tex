\section{state of the art}
In order to improve the optical properties of solar cells a lot of research has been done. It is important to minimise reflections on the sunny side of the solar cell and in addition to that it is also important to guide as much light as possible to the optical active areas of the solar cell. 
Reflected light and light that hits the contact grid and the busbar is lost.

The question I want to deal with in my Bachelorthesis is how to minimise light that hits the contact grid and the busbar. You can reach this by either decreasing the contact grid and the busbars. This can be reached through using back contact solar cells \cite{kerschaver2006back} or emitter wrap through solar cells \cite{gee1992emitter}. 

Another approach is to design the sun-side of the solar cell in a way that the light in the end hits the optical active area.
